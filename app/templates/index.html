<h1>Code with Proofs: The Arena</h1>
<p>Test your Lean 4 skills with our coding challenges!</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to serve as a platform to crowdsource efforts to create data on code-with-proof problems and solutions, including problem-only data as well as problem-with-solution data, both human-created and machine-created. And as a platform to share this data with the open-source community, for the purpose of training open-source coding models.
